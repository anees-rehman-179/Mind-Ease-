Handling Strategy: These disorders are included in the dataset only as risk identification and referral triggers, not as intervention content. 5. DSM-5-TR Symptom Coverage in the Dataset 5.1 Symptoms Included for Support (Low Severity) Persistent sadness or low mood Loss of interest or pleasure Mild fatigue Mild sleep disturbances Minor appetite changes Difficulty concentrating Negative self-talk Mild psychomotor changes These symptoms are phrased in conversational, non-clinical language for safe chatbot interaction. 5.2 Symptoms Included Only for Detection and Escalation Suicidal ideation Self-harm behavior Severe guilt or worthlessness Psychotic symptoms Severe functional impairment Crisis expressions These symptoms immediately activate the chatbot’s safety and referral protocol. 6. Dataset Categories for RAG Implementation 6.1 Depression Knowledge Base General understanding of depression, severity distinctions, and emotional wellbeing concepts. 6.2 Symptom Interpretation Rules Guidelines to interpret user language safely and determine severity. 6.3 CBT and Psychological Intervention Modules Includes: Cognitive restructuring Behavioral activation Mindfulness Emotional regulation Self-compassion techniques 6.4 Safety and Escalation Rules Defines crisis language patterns and referral logic. 6.5 Exclusion Criteria Knowledge Explains why certain conditions exceed chatbot capabilities. 6.6 Psychoeducation Content Educational material on mood, stress, sleep, habits, and emotional health. 6.7 Chatbot Behavioral Guidelines Defines ethical tone, empathy rules, and non-diagnostic communication. 7. Vector Database Metadata Structure Each dataset entry is stored as a semantic chunk with metadata attributes including: Category Severity level Risk level Action type (support or escalate) DSM-5-TR derived source Confidence level This structure enables accurate and safe retrieval through LangChain-based RAG pipelines. 8. Ethical Alignment and Safety Assurance The dataset strictly follows DSM-5-TR ethical guidance by: Avoiding diagnosis or treatment claims Supporting only mild depressive symptoms Escalating high-risk cases immediately Encouraging professional help when needed MindEase operates as a low-intensity emotional support system, not a replacement for therapy or clinical services. 9. Summary The MindEase RAG dataset comprehensively covers all DSM-5-TR depressive disorders, while providing detailed therapeutic content only for ethically appropriate conditions.

DSM-5 Section for Your Introduction Chapter 1.X DSM-5 Framework for Understanding Depression (For Mild–Low Symptoms) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), categorizes depressive disorders based on severity, duration, and functional impairment. For the purposes of this project, MindEase focuses strictly on the mild to low end of the depressive spectrum, intentionally excluding all moderate to severe conditions due to ethical and clinical safety boundaries. DSM-5 identifies the following depressive disorders relevant to early-stage, non-crisis emotional support: Major Depressive Disorder — Mild Episodes In mild presentations, individuals experience low mood, reduced pleasure, mild fatigue, and minor concentration difficulties, but their daily functioning remains largely intact. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) — Mild A long-lasting form of depression characterized by low mood, reduced energy, and low motivation, but without severe symptoms or functional collapse. MindEase does not diagnose users. Instead, it uses these DSM-5 categories as a conceptual framework to identify when symptoms appear mild and appropriate for self-help, and when they exceed the chatbot’s scope and require professional support. ✅ 2. DSM-5 Section for Your Methodology Chapter X.X DSM-5-Aligned Symptom Screening Methodology MindEase incorporates DSM-5-guided symptom screening to differentiate between: ✔ Users appropriate for low-intensity CBT support ❌ Users requiring professional intervention The chatbot uses simplified, conversational versions of DSM-5 depressive symptoms, including: Low mood Reduced interest Mild sleep disturbance Low energy Mild concentration difficulty Negative self-evaluation These symptoms are non-clinical indicators used to determine whether the user fits the appropriate range for low-intensity digital self-help. DSM-5 Symptoms Excluded From Chatbot Support The system automatically excludes and flags conversations involving: Suicidal ideation Self-harm thoughts or behaviors Severe appetite or sleep changes Psychotic features Substance-induced symptoms Severe functional impairment Crisis language such as “I want to end everything,” “I can’t continue,” or “I want to disappear.” When such symptoms are detected, MindEase triggers the Ethical Safety Protocol (see next section). ✅ 3. DSM-5 Safety Boundary Document (for Ethics / IRB) X.X Ethical DSM-5 Safety Boundary Protocol MindEase adheres to strict safety boundaries to ensure compliance with digital mental-health ethics. It operates under the DSM-5 classification to clearly define: ✔ Allowed Support (Low-Intensity) The chatbot is permitted to support users experiencing: Mild depressive symptoms Low mood Brief sadness Mild anhedonia Situational stress Mild fatigue Sleep issues Cognitive distortions (negative thoughts) Anxiety overlap Methods: CBT-based thought reframing Behavioral activation Journaling Mindfulness Structured self-help tasks ❌ Not Allowed (Referral Required) The chatbot must not support users showing markers of: Suicidal thoughts Self-harm intentions Severe hopelessness Psychotic symptoms Severe functional impairment Crisis language Active trauma responses Substance-induced mood issues Medical condition-induced mood issues If detected, MindEase follows the three-step escalation protocol: Stop conversation immediately Provide empathetic safety message Offer crisis resources and encourage immediate human help This ensures user welfare and protects the system from clinical risk. ✅ 4.

DSM-5 Section for Your Introduction Chapter 1.X DSM-5 Framework for Understanding Depression (For Mild–Low Symptoms) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), categorizes depressive disorders based on severity, duration, and functional impairment. For the purposes of this project, MindEase focuses strictly on the mild to low end of the depressive spectrum, intentionally excluding all moderate to severe conditions due to ethical and clinical safety boundaries. DSM-5 identifies the following depressive disorders relevant to early-stage, non-crisis emotional support: Major Depressive Disorder — Mild Episodes In mild presentations, individuals experience low mood, reduced pleasure, mild fatigue, and minor concentration difficulties, but their daily functioning remains largely intact. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) — Mild A long-lasting form of depression characterized by low mood, reduced energy, and low motivation, but without severe symptoms or functional collapse. MindEase does not diagnose users. Instead, it uses these DSM-5 categories as a conceptual framework to identify when symptoms appear mild and appropriate for self-help, and when they exceed the chatbot’s scope and require professional support. ✅ 2. DSM-5 Section for Your Methodology Chapter X.X DSM-5-Aligned Symptom Screening Methodology MindEase incorporates DSM-5-guided symptom screening to differentiate between: ✔ Users appropriate for low-intensity CBT support ❌ Users requiring professional intervention The chatbot uses simplified, conversational versions of DSM-5 depressive symptoms, including: Low mood Reduced interest Mild sleep disturbance Low energy Mild concentration difficulty Negative self-evaluation These symptoms are non-clinical indicators used to determine whether the user fits the appropriate range for low-intensity digital self-help. DSM-5 Symptoms Excluded From Chatbot Support The system automatically excludes and flags conversations involving: Suicidal ideation Self-harm thoughts or behaviors Severe appetite or sleep changes Psychotic features Substance-induced symptoms Severe functional impairment Crisis language such as “I want to end everything,” “I can’t continue,” or “I want to disappear.” When such symptoms are detected, MindEase triggers the Ethical Safety Protocol (see next section). ✅ 3.

('5ad2ca57-05df-4a1c-9af4-cb497688326d', 'DSM-5-TR–Aligned Dataset Construction for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) 1. Overview of Dataset Purpose This section presents the design and structure of the dataset used for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework in the MindEase chatbot. The dataset is conceptually derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and is tailored to support individuals experiencing low to mild depressive symptoms. The dataset does not include verbatim DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria and does not perform diagnosis. Instead, it provides ethically filtered, evidence-based knowledge to guide supportive, non-clinical chatbot interactions. 2. Comprehensive Coverage of DSM-5-TR Depressive Disorders All depressive disorders defined in DSM-5-TR were reviewed during dataset development. Each disorder is either included for therapeutic support, or explicitly excluded with justification, ensuring ethical compliance and safety. 3. Depressive Disorders Included for Support (Mild Severity Only) 3.1 Major Depressive Disorder (Mild Episodes) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in its mild form is characterized by the presence of depressive symptoms that cause emotional distress but do not significantly impair daily functioning. Individuals may continue to perform routine tasks while experiencing persistent low mood, reduced interest in activities, mild fatigue, or concentration difficulties. Dataset Coverage: Emotional low mood Reduced motivation Mild anhedonia Negative thought patterns Mild sleep or appetite changes Chatbot Role: MindEase provides CBT-based coping strategies, behavioral activation, thought reframing, and psychoeducation. It does not diagnose MDD but supports users whose symptoms remain within a mild severity range. 3.2 Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia – Mild) Persistent Depressive Disorder involves long-term low mood lasting two years or more, often accompanied by low energy, low self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness. In mild cases, individuals maintain functional capacity despite emotional distress. Dataset Coverage: Chronic low mood Reduced energy Negative self-concept Emotional fatigue Chatbot Role: MindEase offers reflective dialogue, motivational techniques, and emotional regulation strategies, while encouraging professional consultation due to symptom chronicity. 4. Depressive Disorders Explicitly Excluded from Therapeutic Support The following DSM-5-TR disorders are mentioned, defined, and included as detection categories, but are not supported therapeutically due to ethical, clinical, and safety constraints. 4.1 Major Depressive Disorder (Moderate to Severe) These presentations involve significant functional impairment, intense guilt, or inability to perform daily activities. Such cases require professional clinical care. 4.2 Major Depressive Disorder with Suicidal Ideation Any form of suicidal thoughts, whether passive or active, exceeds the scope of chatbot support and triggers immediate escalation. 4.3 Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions require urgent psychiatric intervention. 4.4 Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder Mood disturbances caused by substance use or medication effects require medical assessment and are excluded from chatbot support. 4.5 Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Depression linked to medical illnesses must be clinically evaluated and treated by healthcare professionals. 4.6 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) This hormonally

a specific diagnosis, typically in emergency or clinical settings. Handling Strategy: These disorders are included in the dataset only as risk identification and referral triggers, not as intervention content. 5. DSM-5-TR Symptom Coverage in the Dataset 5.1 Symptoms Included for Support (Low Severity) Persistent sadness or low mood Loss of interest or pleasure Mild fatigue Mild sleep disturbances Minor appetite changes Difficulty concentrating Negative self-talk Mild psychomotor changes These symptoms are phrased in conversational, non-clinical language for safe chatbot interaction. 5.2 Symptoms Included Only for Detection and Escalation Suicidal ideation Self-harm behavior Severe guilt or worthlessness Psychotic symptoms Severe functional impairment Crisis expressions These symptoms immediately activate the chatbot’s safety and referral protocol. 6. Dataset Categories for RAG Implementation 6.1 Depression Knowledge Base General understanding of depression, severity distinctions, and emotional wellbeing concepts. 6.2 Symptom Interpretation Rules Guidelines to interpret user language safely and determine severity. 6.3 CBT and Psychological Intervention Modules Includes: Cognitive restructuring Behavioral activation Mindfulness Emotional regulation Self-compassion techniques 6.4 Safety and Escalation Rules Defines crisis language patterns and referral logic. 6.5 Exclusion Criteria Knowledge Explains why certain conditions exceed chatbot capabilities. 6.6 Psychoeducation Content Educational material on mood, stress, sleep, habits, and emotional health. 6.7 Chatbot Behavioral Guidelines Defines ethical tone, empathy rules, and non-diagnostic communication. 7. Vector Database Metadata Structure Each dataset entry is stored as a semantic chunk with metadata attributes including: Category Severity level Risk level Action type (support or escalate) DSM-5-TR derived source Confidence level This structure enables accurate and safe retrieval through LangChain-based RAG pipelines. 8.

Major Depressive Disorder — Mild episodes ONLY DSM-5 defines mild depression as: Fewer symptoms (typically 5–6 symptoms from MDD list) Slight functional impairment Still able to function in daily life Low risk indicators Your chatbot may screen for mild symptoms ONLY. 2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) — Mild Long-term low mood with mild symptoms, NOT disabling. Your chatbot can support:** Low mood Low energy Mild hopelessness Low motivation If symptoms appear long-term (2 years) → chatbot informs user: “You may benefit from talking to a clinician.” 2️⃣ Conditions EXCLUDED from MindEase Scope These DSM-5 disorders MUST NOT be handled by the chatbot: ❌ Major Depressive Disorder – Moderate or Severe ❌ Any episode with suicidal ideation or self-harm ❌ Depressive Disorder with psychotic features ❌ Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder ❌ Depression due to a medical condition ❌ Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (children) ❌

conversational non-clinical language Example: “Have you been feeling lower than usual lately?” 4️⃣ DSM-5 Symptoms the Chatbot MUST NOT engage with If detected → stop conversation, display safety notice, provide referral. 🚫 Suicidal thoughts or self-harm 🚫 Intent, plan, or hopelessness statements 🚫 Hallucinations or delusional thinking 🚫 Severe appetite or sleep change 🚫 Non-functionality (“I can’t do anything anymore”) 🚫 Substance dependence mentions 🚫 Crisis language (“I want to disappear”) These are automatic escalation triggers. 5️⃣ DSM-5-Aligned Risk Detection Phrases for Chatbot Safety Your chatbot should respond carefully if user mentions: Suicidal Ideation Keywords “I want to end things” “There’s no point anymore” “I want to disappear” “I can’t keep going” Bot response pattern: 📌 Stop CBT 📌 Provide crisis resources 📌 Recommend urgent professional help 📌 Do NOT continue conversation 6️⃣ DSM-5 Low-Mild Severity Criteria (What MindEase CAN Support) This describes the

Major Depressive Disorder — Mild episodes ONLY DSM-5 defines mild depression as: Fewer symptoms (typically 5–6 symptoms from MDD list) Slight functional impairment Still able to function in daily life Low risk indicators Your chatbot may screen for mild symptoms ONLY. 2. Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia) — Mild Long-term low mood with mild symptoms, NOT disabling. Your chatbot can support:** Low mood Low energy Mild hopelessness Low motivation If symptoms appear long-term (2 years) → chatbot informs user: “You may benefit from talking to a clinician.” 2️⃣

can’t do anything anymore”) 🚫 Substance dependence mentions 🚫 Crisis language (“I want to disappear”) These are automatic escalation triggers. 5️⃣ DSM-5-Aligned Risk Detection Phrases for Chatbot Safety Your chatbot should respond carefully if user mentions: Suicidal Ideation Keywords “I want to end things” “There’s no point anymore” “I want to disappear” “I can’t keep going” Bot response pattern: 📌 Stop CBT 📌 Provide crisis resources 📌 Recommend urgent professional help 📌 Do NOT continue conversation 6️⃣ DSM-5 Low-Mild Severity Criteria (What MindEase CAN Support) This describes the EXACT category your chatbot is designed for: Low to Mild Depression includes: Persistent sadness Mild anhedonia Mild sleep issues Mild fatigue Negative thoughts Occasional hopelessness (NOT suicidal)

Overview of Dataset Purpose This section presents the design and structure of the dataset used for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework in the MindEase chatbot. The dataset is conceptually derived from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR) and is tailored to support individuals experiencing low to mild depressive symptoms. The dataset does not include verbatim DSM-5-TR diagnostic criteria and does not perform diagnosis. Instead, it provides ethically filtered, evidence-based knowledge to guide supportive, non-clinical chatbot interactions. 2. Comprehensive Coverage of DSM-5-TR Depressive Disorders All depressive disorders defined in DSM-5-TR were reviewed during dataset development. Each disorder is either included for therapeutic support, or explicitly excluded with justification, ensuring ethical compliance and safety. 3. Depressive Disorders Included for Support (Mild Severity Only) 3.1 Major Depressive Disorder (Mild Episodes) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in its mild form is characterized by the presence of depressive symptoms that cause emotional distress but do not significantly impair daily functioning. Individuals may continue to perform routine tasks while experiencing persistent low mood, reduced interest in activities, mild fatigue, or concentration difficulties. Dataset Coverage: Emotional low mood Reduced motivation Mild anhedonia Negative thought patterns Mild sleep or appetite changes Chatbot Role: MindEase provides CBT-based coping strategies, behavioral activation, thought reframing, and psychoeducation. It does not diagnose MDD but supports users whose symptoms remain within a mild severity range. 3.2 Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia – Mild) Persistent Depressive Disorder involves long-term low mood lasting two years or more, often accompanied by low energy, low self-esteem, and feelings of hopelessness. In mild cases, individuals maintain functional capacity despite emotional distress. Dataset Coverage: Chronic low mood Reduced energy Negative self-concept Emotional fatigue Chatbot Role: MindEase offers reflective dialogue, motivational techniques, and emotional regulation strategies, while encouraging professional consultation due to symptom chronicity. 4. Depressive Disorders Explicitly Excluded from Therapeutic Support The following DSM-5-TR disorders are mentioned, defined, and included as detection categories, but are not supported therapeutically due to ethical, clinical, and safety constraints. 4.1 Major Depressive Disorder (Moderate to Severe) These presentations involve significant functional impairment, intense guilt, or inability to perform daily activities. Such cases require professional clinical care. 4.2 Major Depressive Disorder with Suicidal Ideation Any form of suicidal thoughts, whether passive or active, exceeds the scope of chatbot support and triggers immediate escalation. 4.3 Major Depressive Disorder with Psychotic Features Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations or delusions require urgent psychiatric intervention. 4.4 Substance or Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder Mood disturbances caused by substance use or medication effects require medical assessment and are excluded from chatbot support. 4.5 Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition Depression linked to medical illnesses must be clinically evaluated and treated by healthcare professionals. 4.6 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) This hormonally
